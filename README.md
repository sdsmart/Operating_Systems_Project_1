Simple Bash-like Shell
----------------------
simple_shell.c implements a custom shell program that executes commands passed in from an input file.

It behaves similar to that of a bash shell but only in its basic form.

### Build Instructions
To build this project simply run: gcc -o [result_program] simple_shell.c
Replacing [result_program] with the name of the executable program you desire.

Note: I built this project on a Macbook Pro, which may use a slightly different version of gcc than expected.

### Run Instructions
To run this project, execute: ./result_program input.txt

You should see the shell execute the commands from the input.txt and output them to the terminal.

Feel free to add various commands to the input.txt file.
