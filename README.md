About This Repository
=====================
This project was assigned in my Operating Systems course at the University of Oklahoma.

project_1.c implements a custom shell program that executes commands passed in from an input file.

Build Instructions
------------------
To build this project simply run: gcc -o [result_program] project_1.c
Replacing [result_program] with the name of the executable program you desire.

Note: I built this project on my Macbook Pro, which may use a slightly different version of gcc.

Run Instructions
----------------
To run this project, execute: ./result_program input.txt

You should see the shell execute the commands from the input.txt and output them to the terminal.
